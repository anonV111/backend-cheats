## API development

[API (Application Programming Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) an interface which describes a certain set of rules by which different programs (applications, bots, websites...) can interact with each other. With API calls you can execute certain functions of a program without knowing how it works.

When developing server applications, [different API formats](https://youtu.be/4vLxWqE94l4) can be used, depending on the tasks and requirements.
