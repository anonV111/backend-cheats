## Network & Internet

[Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) is a worldwide system that connects computer networks from around the world into a single network for storing/transferring information. The Internet was originally developed for the military. But soon it began to be implemented in universities, and then it could be used by private companies, which began to organize networks of providers that provide Internet access services to ordinary citizens. By early 2020, the number of Internet users exceeded 4.5 billion.
