### Web application vulnerabilities

-   [Cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
    > An attack that allows an attacker to inject malicious code through a website into the browsers of other users.
-   [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)
    > An attack is possible if the user input that is passed to the SQL query is able to change the meaning of the statement or add another query to it.
-   [Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
    > When a site uses a POST request to perform a transaction, the attacker can forge a form, such as in an email, and send it to the victim. The victim, who is an authorized user interacting with this email, can then unknowingly send a request to the site with the data that the attacker has set.
-   [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking)
    > The principle is based on the fact that an invisible layer is placed on top of the visible web page, in which the page the intruder wants is loaded, while the control (button, link) needed to perform the desired action is combined with the visible link or button the user is expected to click on.
-   [Denial of Service (DoS attack)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack)
    > A hacker attack that overloads the server running the web application by sending a huge number of requests.
-   [Man-in-the-Middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
    > A type of attack in which an attacker gets into the chain between two (or more) communicating parties to intercept a conversation or data transmission.
-   Incorrect security configuration
    > Using default configuration settings can be dangerous because it is common knowledge. For example, a common vulnerability is that network administrators leave the default logins and passwords _admin:admin_.
