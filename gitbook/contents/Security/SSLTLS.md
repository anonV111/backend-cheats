### SSL/TLS

[SSL (Secure Socket Layer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0) and [TLS (Transport Layer Security)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) are cryptographic protocols that allow secure transmission of data between two computers on a network. These protocols work essentially the same and there are no differences. SSL is considered obsolete, although it is still used to support older devices.

-   [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)
    > TLS/SSL uses digital certificates issued by a certificate authority. One of the most popular is [Let’s Encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Encrypt).
-   Certificate configuration and installation
    > You need to know how to generate certificates and install them properly to make your server work over HTTPS.
-   [Handshake process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake)
    > To establish a secure connection between the client and the server, a special process must take place which includes the exchange of secret keys and information about encryption algorithms.
