This repository is a visual cheatsheet on the main topics in Backend-development. All material is divided into chapters that include different topics. There are three main parts to each topic:

-   **Visual part** - various images/tables/cheatsheets for better understanding (may not be available). All pictures and tables are made from scratch, specifically for this repository.
-   **Summary** - A very brief summary with a list of key terms and concepts. The terms are hyperlinked to the appropriate section on Wikipedia or a similar reference resource.
-   **References to sources** - resources where you may find complete information on a particular issue (they are hidden under a spoiler, which opens when clicked). If possible, the most authoritative sources are indicated, or those that provide information in as simple and comprehensible language as possible.
