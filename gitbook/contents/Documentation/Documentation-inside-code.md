### Documentation inside code

For every modern programming language there are [special tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentation_generator) which allow you to write documentation directly in the program code. So you can read the description of methods, functions, structures and so on right inside your IDE. As a rule, this kind of documentation is done in the form of ordinary comments, taking into account some syntactic peculiarities.

-   Why do you need it?
    > To make your work and the work of other developers easier. In the long run this will save more time than _traveling through the code_ to figure out how everything works, what parameters to pass to functions or to find out what methods this or that class has. Over time, you will inevitably forget your own code, so already written documentation will be useful to you personally.
-   What does it take to get started?
    > For each language, it's different. Many have their own well-established approaches:
    >
    > -   [Docstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for Python.
    > -   [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) for JavaScript.
    > -   [Godoc](https://go.dev/doc/comment) for Go.
    > -   [KDoc and Dokka](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-doc.html) for Kotlin.
    > -   [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) for Java.
    > -   And look for others on request: `documentation engine for <your lang>`.
