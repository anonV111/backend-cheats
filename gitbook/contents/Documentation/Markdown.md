### Markdown

A standard in the development world. An incredibly simple, yet powerful markup language for describing your projects. As a matter of fact, the resource you are reading right now is written with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

    > A cheatsheet on all the syntactic possibilities of the language.

    > A collection of various resources for working with Markdown.
-   [Awesome README](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)
    > A collection of beautiful README.md files (this is the main file of any repository on GitHub that uses Markdown).
-   Markdown for your notes
    > Markdown is not only used for writing documentation. This incredible tool is great for learning - creating digital notes. Personally, I use [Obsidian editor](https://obsidian.md/) for outlining new material.
