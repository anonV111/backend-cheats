### Code quality

During these long years that programming has existed, a huge amount of code, programs, and entire systems have been written. And as a consequence, there have been all sorts of problems in the development of all this. First of all they were related to scaling, support, and the entry threshold for new developers. Clever people, of course, did not sit still and started to solve these problems, thus creating so-called patterns/principles/approaches for writing high-quality code.

By learning programming best practices, you will not only make things better for yourself, but also for others, because other developers will be working with your code.

-   [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
-   [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
-   [YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)
-   [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
-   [GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)>)

For many languages there are special style guides and coding conventions. They usually compare the right and wrong way of writing code and explain why this is the case.
