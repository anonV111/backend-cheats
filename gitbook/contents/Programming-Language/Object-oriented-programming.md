### Object-oriented programming

[OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is one of the most successful and convenient approaches for modeling real-world things. This approach combines several very important principles which allow writing modular, extensible, and loosely coupled code.

-   Understanding [Classes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)>)
    > A class can be understood as a custom data type (a kind of template) in which you describe the structure of future objects that will implement the class. Classes can contain `properties` (these are specific fields in which data of a particular data type can be stored) and `methods` (these are functions that have access to properties and the ability to manipulate, modify them).
-   Understanding [objects](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)>)
    > An object is a specific implementation of a class. If, for example, the _name_ property with type _string_ is described in a class, the object will have a specific value for that field, for example _"Alex"_.
-   [Inheritance principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)>)
    > Ability to create new classes that inherit properties and methods of their parents. This allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes.
-   [Encapsulation principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>)
    > Ability to hide certain properties/methods from external access, leaving only a simplified interface for interacting with the object.
-   [Polymorphism principle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)>)
    > The ability to implement the same method differently in descendant classes.
-   [Composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) over inheritance
    > Often the principle of `inheritance` can complicate and confuse your program if you do not think carefully about how to build the future hierarchy. That is why there is an alternative (more flexible) approach called composition. In particular, Go language lacks classes and many OOP principles, but widely [uses composition](https://golangbyexample.com/oop-inheritance-golang-complete).
-   [Dependency injection (DI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
    > Dependency injection is a popular OOP pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies (other objects) from the outside rather than creating them internally. It promotes loose coupling between classes, making code more modular, maintainable, and easier to test.
