### Language Basics

By foundations are meant some fundamental ideas present in every language.

-   Variables and constants
    > Are names assigned to a memory location in the program to store some data.
-   Data types
    > Define the type of data that can be stored in a variable. The main data types are integers, floating point numbers, symbols, strings, and boolean.
-   Operators
    > Used to perform operations on variables or values. Common operators include arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and assignment operators.
-   Flow control
    > Loops, conditions `if else`, `switch case` statements.
-   Functions
    > Are blocks of code that can be called multiple times in a program. They allow for code reusability and modularization. Functions are an important concept for understanding the scope of variables.
-   Data structures
    > Special containers in which data are stored according to certain rules. Main data structures are arrays, maps, trees, graphs.
-   Standard library
    > This refers to the language's built-in features for manipulating data structures, working with the file system, network, cryptography, etc.
-   Error handling
    > Used to handle unexpected events that can occur during program execution.
-   [Regular expressions](https://github.com/cheatsnake/regex-by-example)
    > A powerful tool for working with strings. Be sure to familiarize yourself with it in your language, at least on a basic level.
-   Modules
    > Writing the code of the whole program in one file is not at all convenient. It is much more readable to break it up into smaller modules and import them into the right places.
-   Package Manager
    > Sooner or later, there will be a desire to use third-party libraries.

After mastering the minimal base for writing the simplest programs, there is not much point in continuing to learn without having specific goals (without practice, everything will be forgotten). You need to think of/find something that you would like to create yourself (a game, a chatbot, a website, a mobile/desktop application, whatever). For inspiration, check out these repositories: [Build your own x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) and [Project based learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning).

At this point, the most productive part of learning begins: You just look for all kinds of information to implement your project. Your best friends are Google, YouTube, and Stack Overflow.
