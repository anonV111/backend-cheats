### Advanced Topics

-   [Garbage collector](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>)
    > A process that has made high-level languages very popular - it allows the programmer not to worry about memory allocation and freeing. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the subtleties of its operation in your own language.
-   [Debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)
    > Handy tool for analyzing program code and identifying errors.
-   [Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), [interpreters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) and [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)
    > Depending on what your language uses, you can explore in detail the process of converting your code to machine code (a set of zeros and ones). As a rule, compilation/interpretation/virtualization processes consist of several steps. By understanding them you can optimize your programs for faster builds and efficient execution.
