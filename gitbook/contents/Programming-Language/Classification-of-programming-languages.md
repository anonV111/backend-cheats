### Classification of programming languages

There are many programming languages. They are all created for a reason. Some languages may be very specific and used only for certain purposes. Also, different languages may use different approaches to writing programs. They may even run differently on a computer. In general, there are many different [classifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Programming_language_classification), which would be useful to understand.

-   Depending on language level
    -   [Low level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)
        > As close to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code), complex to write, but as productive as possible. As a rule, it provides access to all of the computer's resources.
    -   [High-level languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
        > They have a fairly high level of abstraction, which makes them easy to write and easy to use. As a rule, they are safer because they do not provide access to all of the computer's resources.
-   Depending on [implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_implementation)
    -   [Compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)
        > Allows you to convert the source code of a program to an executable file.
    -   [Interpretation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>)
        > The source code of a program is translated and immediately executed (interpreted) by a special interpreter program.
    -   [Virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)
        > In this approach, the program is not compiled into a machine code, but into machine-independent low-level code - [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode). This bytecode is then executed by the virtual machine itself.
-   [Depending on the programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)
    -   [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)
        > Focuses on describing the steps to solve a problem through a sequence of statements or commands.
    -   [Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
        > Focuses on describing what the program should do, rather than how it should do it. Examples of declarative languages include SQL and HTML.
    -   [Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
        > Based on the idea of treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes [immutability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object), avoiding [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)), and using [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). Examples of functional languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure.
    -   [Object-Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
        > Revolves around creating objects that contain both data and behavior, with the goal of modeling real-world concepts. Examples of object-oriented languages include Java, Python, and C++.
    -   [Concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)
        > Focused on handling multiple tasks or threads at the same time, and is used in systems that require high performance and responsiveness. Examples of concurrent languages include Go and Erlang.
