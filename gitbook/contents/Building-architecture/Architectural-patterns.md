### Architectural patterns

-   [Layered](https://ducmanhphan.github.io/2020-02-20-Layered-architecture-pattern/)
    > Used to structure programs that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks, each of which is at a particular level of abstraction. Each layer provides services to the next higher layer.
-   [Client-server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)
    > The server component will provide services to multiple client components. Clients request services from the server and the server provides relevant services to those clients.
-   [Master-slave](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)>)
    > The master component distributes the work among identical slave components, and computes a final result from the results which the slaves return.
-   [Pipe-filter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters)
    > Each processing step is enclosed within a filter component. Data to be processed is passed through pipes. These pipes can be used for buffering or for synchronization purposes.
-   [Broker pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker_pattern)
    > A broker component is responsible for the coordination of communication among components.
-   [Peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)
    > Peers may function both as a client, requesting services from other peers, and as a server, providing services to other peers. A peer may act as a client or as a server or as both, and it can change its role dynamically with time.
-   [Event-bus](https://medium.com/elixirlabs/event-bus-implementation-s-d2854a9fafd5)
    > Has 4 major components; event source, event listener, channel and event bus. Sources publish messages to particular channels on an event bus.
-   [Model-view-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
    > Separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to, and accepted from, the user.
-   [Blackboard](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_(design_pattern)>)
    > Useful for problems for which no deterministic solution strategies are known.
-   [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern)
    > Used for designing a component that interprets programs written in a dedicated language.
