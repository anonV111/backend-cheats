### Postman/Insomnia

When creating a server application, it is necessary to test its workability. This can be done in different ways. One of the easiest is to use the console utility [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL). But this is good for very simple applications. Much more efficient is to use special software for testing, which have a user-friendly interface and all the necessary functionality to create collections of queries.

-   [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
    > A very popular and feature-rich program. It definitely has everything you might need and more: from the trivial creation of collections to raising mock-servers. The basic functionality of the application is free of charge.
-   [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)
    > Not as popular, but a very nice tool. The interface in Insomnia, minimalist and clear. It has less functionality, but everything you need: collections, variables, work with GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, etc. It is possible to install third-party plugins.
