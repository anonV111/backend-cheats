### AI tools

Artificial intelligence systems have made an incredible leap recently. Every day there are more and more tools that can write code for you, generate documentation, do code reviews, help you learn new technologies, and so on. Many people are still skeptical about the capabilities and quality of content that AI creates. But at least by now, a lot of time and resources can be saved to increase the productivity of any developer.
