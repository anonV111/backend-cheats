### Web servers

<p align="center"><img src="../../../original/files/software/web-server_eng.png" alt="Web server"/></p>

A [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) is a program designed to handle incoming HTTP requests. In addition, it can keep error logs (logs), perform authentication and authorization, store rules for file processing, etc.

-   What is it for?
    > Not all languages can have a built-in web server (e.g., PHP). Therefore, to run web applications written in such languages, a third-party one is needed. <br>
    > A single server (virtual or dedicated) can run several applications, but only one external IP address. A configured web server solves this problem and can redirect incoming requests to the right applications.
-   Popular web servers
    > [Nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx) – the most popular at the moment. <br>
    > [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server) – also popular, but already giving up its position. <br>
    > [Caddy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy_(web_server)>) – a fairly young web server with great potential.
