### Ngrok

[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a tool for creating public [tunnels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol) on the Internet that allows local network applications (web servers, websites, bots, etc.) to be accessible from outside.

- How does it work?
    > Ngrok creates a temporary public URL that can be used to access your local server from the Internet. Once Ngrok is started, you have access to the console, where you can monitor requests, handling, and responses to those requests, and configure additional features such as authentication and encryption.
- What to use it for?
    > For example, to test web sites and APIs, to demonstrate running applications on a local server, to access local network applications over the Internet without having to set up a router, firewall, proxy server, etc.
