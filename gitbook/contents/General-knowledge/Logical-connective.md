### Logical connective

[Logical connective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective) are widely used in programming to handle boolean types (true/false or 1/0). The result of a boolean expression is also a value of a boolean type.

-   Basic logical operations
    > They are the basis of other all kinds of operations. <br>
    > There are three in total: [Operation AND (&&, Conjunction)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction), [operation OR (||, Disjunction)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction), [operation NOT (!, Negation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation).
-   Operation [Exclusive OR (XOR, Modulo 2 Addition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or)
    > An important operation that is fundamental to coding theory and computer networks.
-   [Truth Tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table)
    > For logical operations, there are special tables that describe the input data and the return result.
-   Priority of operations
    > The `NOT` operator has the highest priority, followed by the `AND` operator, and then the `OR` operator. You can change this behavior using round brackets.
