### Text encodings

Computers work only with numbers, or more precisely, only with 0 and 1. It is already clear how to convert numbers from different number systems to binary. But you can't do that with text. That's why special tables called [encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) were invented, in which text characters are assigned numeric equivalents.

-   [ASCII (American standard code for information interchange)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
    > The simplest encoding created specifically for the American alphabet. Consists of 128 characters.
-   [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)
    > This is an international character table that, in addition to the English alphabet, contains the alphabets of almost all countries. It can hold more than a million different characters (the table is currently incomplete).
-   [UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
    > UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding that can be used to represent any Unicode character.
-   [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16)
    > Its main difference from UTF-8 is that its structural unit is not one but two bytes. That is, in UTF-16 any Unicode character can be encoded by either two or four bytes.
