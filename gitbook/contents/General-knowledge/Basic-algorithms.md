### Basic algorithms

[Algorithms](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmus) refer to sets of sequential instructions (steps) that lead to the solution of a given problem. Throughout human history, a huge number of algorithms have been invented to solve certain problems in the most efficient way. Accordingly, the correct choice of algorithms in programming will allow you to create the fastest and most resource-intensive solutions.

> There is a very good book about algorithms for beginners – [Grokking algorithms](https://edu.anarcho-copy.org/Algorithm/grokking-algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious.pdf). You can start [learning a programming language](#programming-language) in parallel with reading it.

-   [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)
    > Maximum efficient search algorithm for sorted lists.
-   [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)
    > At each step of the algorithm, the minimum element is searched for and then swapped with the current iteration element.
-   [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion)
    > When a function can call itself and so on to infinity. On the one hand, recursion-based solutions look very elegant, but on the other hand, this approach quickly leads to Stack Overflow and is recommended to be avoided.
-   [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
    > At each iteration neighboring elements are sequentially compared, and if the order of the pair is wrong, the elements are swapped.
-   [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
    > Improved bubble sorting method.
-   [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
    > Allows finding all shortest paths from a given vertex of the graph.
-   [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
    > Finds the shortest paths between all vertices of a graph and their length.
-   [Greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
    > An algorithm that at each step makes locally the best choice in the hope that the final solution will be optimal.
