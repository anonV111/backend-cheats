### Numeral systems

[Numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) is a set of symbols and rules for denoting numbers. In computer science, it is customary to distinguish four main number systems: binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. It is connected, first of all, with their use in various branches of programming.

-   [Binary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)
    > The most important system for computing technology. Its use is justified by the fact that the logic of the processor is based on only two states (on/off, open/closed, high/low, true/false, yes/no, high/low).

-   [Octal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal)
    > It is used e.g., on Linux systems to grant access rights.

-   [Decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal)
    > A system that is easy to understand for most people.
-   [Hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)
    > The letters A, B, C, D, E, F are additionally used for recording. It is widely used in low-level programming and computer documentation because the minimum addressable memory unit is an 8-bit byte, the values of which are conveniently written in two hexadecimal digits.
