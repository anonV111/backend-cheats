### Database classification

Databases can differ significantly from each other and therefore have different areas of application. To understand what database is suitable for this or that task, it is necessary to understand the classification.

-   [Relational DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model)
    > These are repositories where data is organized as a set of tables (with rows and columns). Interactions between data are organized on the basis of links between these tables. This type of database provides fast and efficient access to structured information.
-   [Object-oriented DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database)
    > Here data is represented as objects with a set of attributes and methods. Suitable for cases where you need high-performance processing of data with a complex structure.
-   [Distributed DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database)
    > Composed of several parts located on different computers (servers). Such databases may completely exclude information duplication, or completely duplicate it in each distributed copy (for example, as [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)).
-   [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)
    > Stores and processes unstructured or weakly structured data. This type of database is subdivided into subtypes:
    >
    > -   [Key–value DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database) <br>
    > -   [Column family DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_family) <br>
    > -   [Document-oriented DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) (store data as a hierarchy of documents) <br>
    > -   [Graph DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) (are used for data with a large number of links)
