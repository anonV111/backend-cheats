### ACID Requirements

[ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) is an acronym consisting of the names of the four main properties that guarantee the reliability of transactions in the database.

-   [Atomicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)>)
    > Guarantees that the transaction will be executed completely or not executed at all.
-   [Consistency](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)>)
    > Ensures that each successful transaction captures only valid results (any inconsistencies are excluded).
-   [Isolation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)>)
    > Guarantees that one transaction cannot affect the other in any way.
-   [Durability](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)>)
    > Guarantees that the changes made by the transaction are saved.
