## Programming Language

At this stage you have to choose one programming language to study. There is plenty of information on various languages in the Internet (books, courses, thematic sites, etc.), so you should have no problem finding information.

> Below is a list of specific languages that [personally, in my opinion](https://github.com/cheatsnake) are good for backend development (⚠️ may not agree with the opinions of others, including those more competent in this matter).

-   [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>)
> A very popular language with a wide range of applications. Easy to learn due to its simple syntax.
-   [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
> No less popular and practically the only language for full-fledged Web-development. Thanks to the platform [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) last few years is gaining popularity in the field of backend development as well.
-   [Go](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>)
> A language created internally by Google. It was created specifically for high-load server development. Minimalist syntax, high performance and rich standard library.
-   [Kotlin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)>)
> A kind of modern version of [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>). Simpler and more concise syntax, better type-safety, built-in tools for multi-threading. One of the best choices for Android development.

Find a good book or online tutorial in English at [this repository](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-langs.md). There is a large collection for different languages and frameworks.

Look for a special [awesome repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#programming-languages) - a resource that contains a huge number of useful links to materials for your language (libraries, cheat sheets, blogs, and other various resources).
