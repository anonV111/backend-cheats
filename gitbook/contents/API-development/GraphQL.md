### GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL) is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that allows you to retrieve and modify data from a server using a single URL endpoint. It provides several benefits, including the ability to retrieve only the data you need (reducing traffic consumption), aggregation of data from multiple sources and a strict type system for describing data.

-   [Schema and types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)
    > Learn how to describe data using GraphQL schema and general types.
-   [Queries and Mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)
    > Queries are used to retrieve data from a server, while Mutations are used to modify (create, update or delete) data on a server.
-   [Resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/)
    > Resolvers are functions that determine how to retrieve the data for a particular field in the GraphQL schema.
-   [Data sources](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/data/data-sources/)
    > Are places where you retrieve data from, such as databases or APIs. Data sources are connected to the GraphQL server through resolvers.
