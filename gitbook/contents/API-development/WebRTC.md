### WebRTC

[WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC) an open-source project for streaming data (video, audio) in a browser. WebRTC operation is based on [peer to peer connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer), however, there are implementations that allow you to organize complex group sessions. For example, the video-calling service [Google Meet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Meet) makes extensive use of WebRTC.
