### Cloud services

Before you can deploy your code, you need to decide where you want to host it. You can rent your own server or use the services of cloud providers, which have great functionality for process automation, monitoring, load balancing, data storing and so on.

-   [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html)
    > Provides a wide range of services for computing, storage, database management, networking, security, and more. AWS is one of the oldest and most established cloud service providers.
-   [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview)
    > It is known for its focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as its integration with other Google services like Google Analytics and Google Maps.
-   [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore)
    > Azure is known for its integration with other Microsoft services like Office 365 and Dynamics 365, as well as its support for a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.
-   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
    > This service provides virtual private servers (VPS) for developers and small businesses. It is also known for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its competitive pricing.
-   [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what)
    > Heroku is known for its ease of use and integration with popular development tools like Git, as well as its support for multiple programming languages and frameworks. It was a very popular choice for open source projects as long as there was a free plan (it costs money now).

As a rule, all of these services have an intuitive simple interface, detailed documentation, as well as many video tutorials on YouTube.
