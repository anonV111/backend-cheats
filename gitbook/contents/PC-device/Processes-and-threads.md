### Processes and threads

<p align="center"><img src="./files/os/process_eng.png" alt="Process"/></p>

-   [Process](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)>)
    > A kind of container in which all the resources needed to run a program are stored. As a rule, the process consists of:
    >
    > -   Executable program code <br>
    > -   Input and output data <br>
    > -   [Call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) (order of instructions for execution) <br>
    > -   [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management#Manual_memory_management) (a structure for storing intermediate data created during the process) <br>
    > -   [Segment descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_descriptor) <br>
    > -   [File descriptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor) <br>
    > -   Information about the set of permissible powers <br>
    > -   Processor status information
-   [Thread](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)>)
    > An entity in which sequences of program actions (procedures) are executed. Threads are within a process and use the same address space. There can be multiple threads in a single process, allowing multiple tasks to be performed. These tasks, thanks to threads, can exchange data, use shared data or the results of other tasks.
