### Concurrency and parallelism

<p align="center"><img src="./files/os/concurrency-parallel.png" alt="Concurrency-parallelism"/></p>

-   [Parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing)
    > The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple processor cores, where each individual core performs a different task.
-   [Concurrency](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)>)
    > The ability to perform multiple tasks, but using a single processor core. This is achieved by dividing tasks into separate blocks of commands which are executed in turn, but switching between these blocks is so fast that for users it seems as if these processes are running simultaneously.
