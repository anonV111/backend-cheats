### Main components (hardware)

-   [Motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard)
    > The most important PC component to which all other elements are connected.
    >
    > -   [Chipset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset) - set of electronic components that responsible for the communication of all motherboard components.
    > -   [CPU socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket) - socket for mounting the processor.
    > -   [VRM (Voltage Regulator Module)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_regulator_module) – module that converts the incoming voltage (usually 12V) to a lower voltage to run the processor, integrated graphics, memory, etc.
    > -   Slots for RAM.
    > -   Expansion slots [PCI-Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express) - designed for connection of video cards, external network/sound cards.
    > -   Slots [M.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2) / [SATA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA) - designed to connect hard disks and SSDs.
-   [CPU (Central processing unit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)
    > The most important device that executes instructions (programme code). Processors only work with 1 and 0, so all programmes are ultimately a set of binary code.
    >
    > -   [Registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register) - the fastest memory in a PC, has an extremely small capacity, is built into the processor and is designed to temporarily store the data being processed.
    > -   [Cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache) - slightly less fast memory, which is also built into the processor and is used to store a copy of data from frequently used cells in the main memory.
    > -   Processors can have different [architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_design). Currently, the most common are the [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64) architecture (desktop and laptop computers) and [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family) (mobile devices as well as the latest Apple computers).
-   [RAM (Random-access memory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)
    > Fast, low capacity memory (4-16GB) designed to temporarily store program code, as well as input, output and intermediate data processed by the processor.
-   [Data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage)
    > Large capacity memory (256GB-1TB) designed for long-term storage of files and installed programmes.
-   [GPU (Graphics card)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card)
    > A separate card that translates and processes data into images for display on a monitor. This device is also called a discrete graphics card. Usually needed for those who do 3D modelling or play games. <br> [Built-in graphics card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit#Integrated_graphics_processing_unit) is a graphics card built into the processor. It is suitable for daily work.
-   [Network card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller)
    > A device that receives and transmits data from other devices connected to the [local network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network).
-   [Sound card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card)
    > A device that allows you to process sound, output it to other devices, record it with a microphone, etc.
-   [Power supply unit](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply_unit_(computer)>)
    > A device designed to convert the AC voltage from the mains to DC voltage.
