### Inter-process communication

A mechanism which allows to exchange data between threads of one or different processes. Processes can be run on the same computer or on different computers connected by a network. [Inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) can be done in different ways.

-   [File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file)
    > The easiest way to exchange data. One process writes data to a certain file, another process reads the same file and thus receives data from the first process.
-   [Signal (IPC)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)>)
    > Asynchronous notification of one process about an event which occurred in another process.
-   [Network socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket)
    > In particular, IP addresses and ports are used to communicate between computers using the TCP/IP protocol stack. This pair defines a socket (_socket_ corresponding to the address and port).
-   [Semaphore](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)>)
    > A counter over which only 2 operations can be performed: increasing and decreasing (and for 0 the decreasing operation is blocked).
-   [Message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) & [Message queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue)
-   [Pipelines](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)>)
    > Redirecting the output of one process to the input of another (similar to a pipe).
