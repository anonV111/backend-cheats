### E2E tests

<p align="center"><img src="./files/testing/testing-pyramid_eng.png" alt="Testing pyramid"/></p>

End-to-end tests imply checking the operation of the entire system as a whole. In this type of testing, the environment is implemented as close to real-life conditions as possible. We can draw the analogy that a robot sits at the computer and presses the buttons in the specified order, as a real user would do.

-   When to use?
    > E2E is the most complex type of test. They take a long time to write and to execute, because they involve the whole application. So if your application is small (e.g., you are the only one developing it), writing Unit and some integration tests will probably be enough.
