### Load testing

When you create a large application that needs to serve a large number of requests, there is a need to test this very ability to withstand heavy loads. There are many utilities available to create [artificial load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_testing).

-   [JMeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JMeter)
    > User-friendly interface, cross-platform, multi-threading support, extensibility, excellent reporting capabilities, support for many protocols for queries.
-   [LoadRunner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoadRunner)
    > It has an interesting feature of virtual users, who do something with the application under test in parallel. This allows you to understand how the work of some users actively doing something with the service affects the work of others.
-   [Gatling](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)>)
    > A very powerful tool oriented to more experienced users. The Scala programming language is used to describe the scripts.
-   [Taurus](https://gettaurus.org/)
    > A whole framework for easier work on JMeter, Gatling and so on. JSON or YAML is used to describe tests.
