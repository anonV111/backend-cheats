## Linux Basics

Operating systems based on [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel) are the standard in the world of server development, since most servers run on such operating systems. Using Linux on servers is profitable because it is free and open source, secure and works fast on cheap hardware.

There are a huge number of [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) (preinstalled software bundles) to suit all tastes. One of the most popular is [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu). This is where you can start your dive into server development.

[Install Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) on a separate PC or laptop. If this is not possible, you can use a special program [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) where you can [run other OS](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#create-vm-wizard) on top of the main OS. You can also run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) [Ubuntu image container](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) (Docker is a [separate topic](#docker) that is exists in this repository).
