### Network problems

<p align="center"><img src="../../../original/files/network-internet/problems_eng.gif" alt="Problems"/></p>

The quality of networks, including the Internet, is far from ideal. This is due to the complex structure of networks and their dependence on a huge number of factors. For example, the stability of the connection between the client device and its router, the quality of service of the provider, the power, and performance of the server, the physical distance between the client and the server, etc.

-   [Latency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency)
    > The time it takes for a data packet to travel from sender to receiver. It depends more on the physical distance.
-   [Packet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss)
    > Not all packets traveling over the network can reach their destination. This happens most often when using wireless networks or due to [network congestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion).
-   [Round Trip Time (RTT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay)
    > The time it takes for the data packet to reach its destination + the time to respond that the packet was received successfully.
-   [Jitter](https://www.ir.com/guides/what-is-network-jitter)
    > Delay fluctuations, unstable ping (for example, 50ms, 120ms, 35ms...).
-   [Packet reordering](https://wiki.geant.org/display/public/EK/PacketReordering)
    > The IP protocol does not guarantee that packets are delivered in the order in which they are sent.
