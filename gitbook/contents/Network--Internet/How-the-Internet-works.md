### How the Internet works

<p align="center"><img src="./files/network-internet/Internet.png" alt="Internet"/></p>

Your computer does not have direct access to the Internet. Instead, it has access to your local network to which other devices are connected via a wired ([Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet)) or wireless (Wi-Fi) connection. The organizer of such a network is a special minicomputer - [router](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)>). This device connects you to your [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider), which in turn is connected to other higher-level ISPs. Thus, all these interactions make up the Internet, and your messages always transit through different networks before reaching the final recipient.

-   [Host](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)>)
    > Any device that is on any network.
-   [Server](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)>)
    > A special computer on the network that serves requests from other computers.

-   [Network topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology)
    > There are several topologies (ways of organizing a network): [Point to point](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)>), [Daisy chain](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_chain_(electrical_engineering)>), [Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_network), [Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_network), [Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network) and [Mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking). The Internet itself cannot be referred to any one topology, because it is an incredibly complex system mixed with different topologies.
