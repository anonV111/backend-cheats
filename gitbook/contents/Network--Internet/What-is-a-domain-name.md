<p align="center"><img src="../../../original/files/network-internet/domain_eng.png" alt="Domain name"/></p>

[Domain Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) are human-readable addresses of web servers available on the Internet. They consist of parts (levels) separated from each other by a dot. Each of these parts provides specific information about the domain name. For example country, service name, localization, etc.

-   Who owns domain names
    > [The ICANN Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN) is the founder of the distributed domain registration system. It gives accreditations to companies that want to sell domains. In this way a competitive domain market is formed.
-   How to buy a domain name
    > A domain name cannot be bought forever. It is leased for a certain period of time. It is better to buy domains from [accredited registrars](https://www.icann.org/en/accredited-registrars?filter-letter=a&sort-direction=asc&sort-param=name&page=1) (you can find them in almost any country).
