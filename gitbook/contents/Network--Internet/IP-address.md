[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is a unique numeric address that is used to recognize a particular device on the network.

-   Levels of visibility
    > -   External and publicly accessible IP address that belongs to your ISP and is used to access the Internet by hundreds of other users.
    > -   The IP address of your router in your ISP's local network, the same IP address from which you access the Internet.
    > -   The IP address of your computer in the local (home) network created by the router, to which you can connect your devices. Typically, it looks like 192.168.XXX.XXX.
    > -   The internal IP address of the computer, inaccessible from the outside and used only for communication between the running processes. It is the same for everyone - 127.0.0.1 or just _localhost_.
-   [Port](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)>)
    > One device (computer) can run many applications that use the network. In order to correctly recognize where and which data coming over the network should be delivered (to which of the applications) a special numerical number - a port is used. That is, each running process on a computer which uses a network connection has its own personal port.
-   [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4)
    > Version 4 of the IP protocol. It was developed in 1981 and limits the address space to about 4.3 billion (2^32) possible unique addresses.
-   [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)
    > Over time, the allocation of address space began to happen at a much faster rate, forcing the creation of a new version of the IP protocol to store more addresses. IPv6 is capable of issuing 2^128 (is huge number) unique addresses.
