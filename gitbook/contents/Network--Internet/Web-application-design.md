### Web application design

Modern [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) consist of two parts: [Frontend and Backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontend_and_backend). Thus implementing a [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model).

The tasks of the Frontend are:

-   Implementation of the user interface (appearance of the application)
    > - A special markup language [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is used to create web pages.
    > - [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) style language is used to style fonts, layout of content, etc.
    > - [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) programming language is used to add dynamics and interactivity. <br>
    > As a rule, these tools are rarely used in their pure form, as so-called [frameworks](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/front-end-frameworks/) and [preprocessors](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-preprocessors/) exist for more convenient and faster development. <br>
-   Creating functionality for generating requests to the server
    > These are usually different types of input forms that can be conveniently interacted with.
-   Receives data from the server and then processes it for output to the client

Tasks of the Backend:

-   Handling client requests
    > Checking for permissions and access, all sorts of validations, etc.
-   Implementing business logic
    > A wide range of tasks can be implied here: working with databases, information processing, computation, etc. This is, so to speak, the heart of the Backend world. This is where all the important and interesting stuff happens.
-   Generating a response and sending it to the client
