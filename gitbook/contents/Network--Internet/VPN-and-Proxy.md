The use of VPNs and Proxy is quite common in recent years. With the help of these technologies, users can get basic anonymity when surfing the web, as well as bypass various regional blockages.

-   [VPN (Virtual Private Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VPN)
    > A technology that allows you to become a member of a private network (similar to your local network), where requests from all participants go through a single public IP address. This allows you to blend in with the general mass of requests from other participants. <br>
    >
    > -   Simple procedure for connection and use. <br>
    > -   Reliable traffic encryption. <br>
    > -   There is no guarantee of 100% anonymity, because the owner of the network knows the IP-addresses of all participants. <br>
    > -   VPNs are useless for dealing with multi-accounts and some programs because all accounts operating from the same VPN are easily detected and blocked. <br>
    > -   Free VPNs tend to be heavily loaded, resulting in unstable performance and slow download speeds. <br>
-   [Proxy (proxy server)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)
    > A proxy is a special server on the network that acts as an intermediary between you and the destination server you intend to reach. When you are connected to a proxy server all your requests will be performed on behalf of that server, that is, your IP address and location will be substituted. <br>
    >
    > -   The ability to use an individual IP address, which allows you to work with multi-accounts. <br>
    > -   Stability of the connection due to the absence of high loads. <br>
    > -   Connection via proxy is provided in the operating system and browser, so no additional software is required. <br>
    > -   There are proxy varieties that provide a high level of anonymity. <br>
    > -   The unreliability of free solutions, because the proxy server can see and control everything you do on the Internet. <br>
